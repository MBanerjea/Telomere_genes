# Telomere_genes
Data wrangling to obtain telomere targets for Thesis 2025:

CBC1 RRP6 KO table was obtained from Kuai et al., 2005.
Kupiec list was obtained from Peretz et al., 2022.

The two datasets were overlapped, naming errors fixed and filtered for telomeric mRNAs that showed a minimum fold change of 1.7 in rrp6 or cbc1 deletion backgrounds.
